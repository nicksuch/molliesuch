                <h2>About Mollie</h2>
                <p>Mollie Such is a dietitian in Lexington, KY. She is passionate about helping people live better, healthier lives. She believes that the classic recipe of diet and exercise will help you find results. She does not believe the hype around fad diets. She does love kale, but isn't afraid of warm fudge brownies topped with ice cream. Hey, all things in moderation!</p>
                <p>Mollie is <a href="http://www.nickandmollie.com" target="_blank">married to</a> Nick, and together they enjoy hiking and camping in the nearby Red River Gorge, playing team sports and guitar, and of course cooking all the time. Nick enjoys helping Mollie chop vegetables and write in the third person. Mollie really wants a Goldendoodle, and she needs your help convincing Nick to get the dog before they start having kids.</p>
